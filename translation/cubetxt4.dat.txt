Reference: Ixmucane Core sensor report



Sensor arrays have detected 3 main types of anomalous readings.



1 - Unknown Zica defense systems.  Most defense systems are radiating large

amounts of infrared energy and are probably thermal based.  An unknown energy

force appears to be directing the thermal energy flow.



2 - Crystalline Ore.  A highly volatile, energy-rich crystal ore has been

detected in this area.  Dralictite and Morenzinum are indicated in fairly

high quantities near the center.



3 - Large Unknown Energy Source.  A central energy source is producing unknown

levels of heat energy.  This source is a critical threat and your heat

shielding will last for approximately 30 seconds in contact with the device.

You will have approximately 10 seconds to destroy the source when within

critical range.

Reference: Sonic Cannon



Rated: ~Not~ ~Funny~



The sonic cannon weapon creates a minute gravitational center using FPP (Forced Particle Packing

technology) which allows a particle field to remain intact.  The gravitational center is destabilized with a

hyper flux modulator before being released from the weapon.  The destabilized gravitational core

modulates at a fixed frequency which is fast enough to create a shimmering field in the optical range

around green.  The frequency generator uses a system of sound wave generators to help modulate the

frequency for the maximum particle dispersal and energy so far possible - hence the damage from the

weapon is caused by the sonic modulators before the weapon is fired.

Reference: Zica Flamethrower



This weapon was found during an excavation of an ancient tunnel-world apparently

build by these strange space-inhabiting creatures.  It is believed the Zica were

not air-breathers but subsisted mostly on thermal radiation and various

liquids for survival.



We believe this had a profound impact on their technological development,

since they appear to have developed tools and devices to manipulate and take

advantage of thermal and other radiation-based energies.  Their mastery of

thermal energy appears to have led to the development of this unique null-space

flamethrower.



What little information which has leaked out of Station Gryphon, where the only

remaining samples of this device are stored, indicates the weapon uses an

energy-based particle field to generate the flame without any external air

or energy source.



Even this limited information would not have been available if it wasn't for

the unfortunate accident which apparently occured when a researcher removed

the outer covering to study the interior.  A large section of the left-rear

portion of Station Gryphon is still missing to this day, a testimony to those

who would fool with something they do not understand.

Rated: ~Not~ ~Funny~



Gryphon Sector is the main secret weapons research center for Microsol.

It was long rumored to be an ordinary military station, but since the

Not-so-Great Gryphon Explosion, Microsol has decided to let it remain in

public knowledge.  In fact, once a year, they invite members of competing

industries to the Station to view how far behind they are in comparison to

Microsol.



Still, the station has had it's share of hardships.  Many pirates of both

the Mikal and Patrok clans have long looked upon it as the pinnacle of their

career if they can infiltrate the station's defenses and land a raiding party

within the research section, then return with something from their weapons

labs.  Most never even make it to the station, destroyed by the dreaded Pong

ships.



One retired pirate of the Patrok clan, one ShipMaster Carlos, wrote a book

detailing highlights of his extensive career.  One of which was the

infiltration and removal of a weapon now commonly referred to as the Zica

Laser Cannon.  He is believed to have been assassinated the next day, but

they were too late to stop Gencore from transmitting his book over Fluxnet.

In addition, his ship was never found, though it is believed to have been

equipped with the Zica Laser.  Two months later, Gencore finished development

of a device also called the Zica Laser.

Reference: Zica Laser Weapon



Rated: ~Not~ ~Funny~



The Zica Laser Weapon was introduced by Gencore after several years of

successful introduction of Zica products by Microsol.  It is still unknown

why so many of these products were named after the Zica, an ancient race

which used to inhabit Gyges, among other tunnel worlds.  However, it is

possible that some of these devices are not simply part of the marketing

frenzy but are actually unique technologies from Gyges.



This weapon is the most likely to be linked to the Gyges excavation, though

oddly enough, Gencore was not involved in the archaeological research.  Still,

the weapon generates forced laser bursts which independent scientists have

not been able to fully explain.  Laser effects are well known for the blue

range of light, but the forced pulse patterns are totally unreasonable.



The only answer that has been given so far is that there may be some unknown

energy working to distort the laser.  Research is still being conducted on

the effects and reactions of the energy, though little has been accomplished.

Reference: Tunnel World, Zica



~Ixmucane~ is the only known tunnel world to have been excavated.  Even though the

~Zica~ had apparently been dead for 421965032 standard years, 14 days, and 32

minutes (~SCI~ estimation), their internal defenses were still partially active and destroyed

many ships who came to investigate the tunnel world.



~Microsol~ launched a giant excavation of the planet, equipped with powerful

destroyers as well as research vessels.  Even still, 241 died trying to stop

the defensive systems.  ~General~ ~Zinglon~ reportedly sacrificed ships to get

through to the control centers, rather than allow the defensive weapons to be

destroyed.



To this day, the tunnel world is a center of ~Microsol~ activity.  Its open

tunnels allow for easy shipbuilding and mining of mineral deposits, as well

as the powerful geothermal energy radiation near the core.  Scientists, however,

are still not certain of the exact second that the last member of the ~Zica~

race on ~Gyges~ died, but believe it is about 25 additional seconds from their

previous estimate (calculated from their exact time of arrival for final excavation).



Researchers quote advances in dating techniques to determine more accurately

the events on ~Gyges~.  Also, they claim the fact that many of their

researchers are still being killed by accidents involving the alien technology

hampers their ability to conduct more tests.



One anonymous ~SCI~ has reported that the advances in dating technology here were worth the lives expended to

reach the core.  In a tightbeam interview he said, "This timing solution will be the crowning moment in my

career.  It's the most important goal to us.  The ~Sun~ ~Project~ is entirely

overrated".

their unique ~Starburst~ defense field.



After the ~Not-so-Great~ ~Gryphon~ ~Explosion~, some aspects of their research were

turned over to public scrutiny, believed to be because of investigations by

families and friends of the twelve thousand crew members that died.  It is

now rumored that they have just developed a new field of weapons technology

which will allow them to build much bigger weapons onto conventional battle

I don't know how you managed it, but we can now extend our efforts toward

these people after all.



No way is this ever going to be a ~Microsol~ world again.  I think I'm going

to be able to convince the other corporations to join me now.  There's no

telling what they would have done if this place became active.



I can tell you now, Trent.



I believe there's no way in this universe we could have stopped ~Microsol~

if this planet was activated.  It might have taken a decade or two, but there's

no way to compete with an unlimited energy source like this.  Best we could

have hoped for was to keep them from controlling it.  With all our best

SCIs dead, though, we couldn't have stopped them.



Trent, the air out there is still at the critical freezing point, so you'd

better get out of there before the coldwave reaches you.  Don't worry about

the people trapped below.  They're pretty safe behind this Zica shielding,

and the energy conduits will reach them first.  You're out there in

on this link,

but suffice it to say - it was our final hope in case we couldn't stop

Microsol someday.  It seems that day has passed me by - the blind fool I've been!

~Trent!?~  Is that you?



I never thought I'd get to see you again so soon.  I can't believe you've

decided to forfeit yourself to try and stop me from taking over this place!



With ~Vykromod~ crippled from the blast you gave his ship, I've taken command

of the fleet.



I've got a nasty surprise waiting down here.  So come on, ~Trent~, be the

hero you've always wanted to be and come after me.  I've got other engagements,

though, once I've blasted the irritating fool in this escape pod.



You're too insignificant to be a part of my plan.  I'd be amazed if you make

it past the missile bays.

Are you Trent?  I have heard of you from ~Transon~.



Forgive me for not introducing myself, but a certain ~crazed~ ~lunatic~ is

hammering on my pod's shielding with ~Lightning~ blasts.  I do not believe there

is a very good probability we will survive much longer, but I need to tell you

what you are up against.



The main defense net consists of ~battle~ ~platforms~.  Most of these launch

~semi-guided~ ~micro~ ~missiles~, though some fire more mundane ~energy~ ~blasts~.  The

missiles are what you should first look out for, though.  I would suggest

equipping some direct ~side-firing~ ~weaponry~ if you have it available.



Halfway through the core you will encounter a large ~battle~ ~section~ which you

should take out first.  This is fairly straightforward, but afterward you will be

attacked with a number of ~giant~ ~semi-guided~ ~missiles~ from behind.  Do not

attempt to destroy these.  Instead, try to conserve your energy and find a way

around them, while keeping a hold on those ~micro~ ~missiles~.



The final ~fleet~ ~ship~ seems to be a multi-stage defense

INCOMING TRANSMISSION from Gencore Command Ship IcoStar II

Transon

We've picked up your transmission of success in defeating the main defense

ship.  I don't mean to criticize your ability, but that seemed too easy.



I think we can repair the damage you did to Deliani without too much trouble.

At least, once we get back into the computer net.  With Mondus, the head

of ~Deliani~ ~Control~, destroyed, we're going to have a tough time trying to

reinterface with the computer.  With all the people you helped us rescue,

the ~IcoStar~ ~II~ should have enough brainpower to crack the security

fairly soon, I hope.



This definitely wasn't their main objective.  We tried to pick up a ~Captain~

~Nob~ escaping from ~Ixmucane~, but were unable to stop him.  All we know is that

he was heading in the direction of ~Savara~.  We sent some supply ships on

ahead to rendezvous with you and some other fighter ships we just dispatched.



They'll be moving in first to take out the chemical processing plants, which

should draw their energy production systems to a halt.  I'm afraid I rebuilt the ~Z-29~

~Central~ ~Defense~ ~Ship~ again, and we improved on the design.

~Microsol's~ probably already captured it with the same security backdoors

they used here.  Sorry.  I need you to go and destroy it again.



Once we get back in and get our sensor grid up we'll be able to help you

some more in locating ~Microsol's~ main target.



Good luck, Trent.

This is your old friend, Trent.  I've managed to take out the ~chemical~

~processing~ ~plants~ here on Savara, but I think we have a problem.



My long-range sensors have detected a ~gigantic~ ~ship~ heading our way.  It's

not the size that bothers me, though.  It's not really all that big in size,

but the ~energy~ ~readings~ I'm getting from it are off the ~scale~.



It appears to also have an ~insane~ ~mass~ ~analysis~ ~reading~, like it was

something as massive as a ~planet~.  I don't like this, Trent.  I must deal

with the ships down here on Savara, but it appears to be interested only in

you, as it's ~matching~ ~your~ ~course~ exactly.



There's about one hour left before it reaches orbit.  My ship is... damaged.

I must humbly admit I won't be able to achieve orbit on my own.  I'm sorry

I couldn't help you out this time, but it is best that I stay and help these

innocents here on Savara, anyway.

How's the war going?  I'm down here with the rest of this rag-tag band trying

I intercepted the other trasmissions you received and don't like either of

them very much, ~Javi~ more so.  I think I can help you out, though.  My ship

isn't equipped for combat, but I've got a heavy-duty ~VLR~ ~sensor~ ~grid~ and a

~TQ930~ ~comm~ ~system~ packed in this baby.  If you keep your comm channel open,

I'll try to feed your computer some holographic data on the dreadnought's weak

points.



It seems that the shielding on that ship is being disrupted by the weird

~gravity~ ~field~, and whenever certain systems are activated, it draws a lot of

power from the shields.  I'll try to pinpoint the ~weaknesses~ for you.  Your

computer will display them on your vidscreen with ~green~, ~holographic~ ~arrows~.

Hello, Trent.  I have picked you up on my comm link again.



Things aren't going too well down here.  Without an outside energy boost, I'm

not sure if our ships are going to hold out.  About half of our group is gone

already and the rest are damaged.



Without outside help, we will not have enough fuel to return home.



Sigh...



Anyway, let's talk some more about hot dogs.  Did you pick some up for me

back on Ixmucane before you took out the ~Microsol~ fleet?  I could really use

one of those right now.



Signing off.

Great job!  We could see the explosion all the way back down here on Savara!

Javi won't be heading any ~Microsol~ attack fleets anymore.



Trent, the others down here aren't doing so well.  I can't help them out

directly, so I've gone back into orbit to try and contact Transon.  Have

you heard anything?



I hope I can get through for backup before we're taken out.  Almost none of us

have operational interstellar drives, and it doesn't look like anyone down

here can help us.



Anyway, I've got a long-range sensor report for you.  Their main battle ships

are headed toward ~Gyges~ for some reason.  If you can, head for ~Gyges~.  I

think they're getting ready to do something really bad now that we've stopped

their main assault.  I'd rather not be here when they're ready.



I may lose contact with you if we can't capture ~Fluxnet~ here on Savara.

Without it, my comm signals won't have the range to reach you out there.



From now on, I'm afraid you're flying blind.  I pray to ~Zinglon~ that ~Transon~

can get the Deli back online.



I hope I hear from you again.

has been called in, headed mainly by Gencore, to save as many people as possible.



[Clara, Co-reporter [~CC~]] : Does it really matter, Rob?  I'm beginning to think

there's nowhere in the galaxy not under some mysterious threat, but somehow it

all seems to work out fairly easily with no deaths on our side.  Isn't this

some kind of a hoax?



[Rob, Reporter [~RR~]] : Seems that way to me.  I can remember when a war was

something you could ~feel~.  Not just some report on how many scraps of metal

HOW TO PLAY

Game

How to play the secret ending game ~ZINGLON'S~ ~REVENGE~:



A giant ship projects a horizontal field of energy.  Small enemies fall down

from above and bounce around the edges of the screen and against the energy

field.  Touching the field or one of the little enemies means almost certain

instant death.



You must shoot all the small enemies to advance to the next level.



There are 4 kinds of enemies:



~Roobles~ : Round Fireballs - Low damage - Move left to right



~Tokkies~ : Spikey Balls - Low damage - Move up and down quickly



~Zimbles~ : Eyeballs - Moderate damage - Move diagonally slowly



~Blottes~ : Blood Cells - High damage - Descend slowly and then bounce up quickly

diagonally





This game consists of 6 levels, starting on ~level~ ~5~ and descending in order

to the final level.



Level 5 : Mostly Roobles



Level 4 : Mostly Tokkies



Extra ship received after Level 5.



Level 3 : Zimbles and Blottes



Level 2 : Roobles, Tokkies, and Blottes



Level 1 : Mostly Zimbles



Extra ship received after Level 1.



Level 0 : Blottes - Destroy the energy field?



Extra ship received after Level 0.



Level -1 : ???

*54

STRATEGY

Game

Strategy Guide for ~ZINGLON'S~ ~REVENGE~:



Obviously the main point to the game is to dodge the little enemies as well

as possible.



~Roobles~ : Round Fireballs - These are very easy to destroy but get in your

way easily once they descend fairly low.  Try to take these out quickly if

you can unless a Blotte is coming.



~Tokkies~ : Spikey Balls - These can be avoided fairly easily since they move

very slowly across the screen.  You can usually position a sidekick to stay

underneath them long enough to take them out.



~Zimbles~ : Eyeballs - These are pretty slow and you can usually delay shooting

them until they start filling the screen.  Try to take out the faster-moving

enemies first if you can.



~Blottes~ : Blood Cells - These are the hardest enemies to destroy in the game.

They are fairly easy to take out while descending, so try to at least to damage

them fairly well.  Once they reach bottom, they'll start bouncing quickly and

can be hard to destroy.



~SECRET~:



Yes, of course there are secret moves in this game.  ~21~ of them, in fact.



Several of the more common ones are detailed below:



~Sidekicks:~ Attach one or two of these to your ship.



  Red sidekick : Press Right,Down,Left, then hold Fire and press Up.



~Hot Dog:~ A blast of deadly dogs.  Uses up your armor slowly, though.



  Press Up, then hold Fire and press Down.



Of course, ~all~ other special moves are also available here.



Good luck!



So far, even the designer has problems winning this game, as it should be!

My general time to beat is ~3:30~, without using many secret moves.

Scenic guide to the universe: ~Savara~

  ~SAVARA:~



~Dining:~



Come and visit the interstellar dining halls in the underwater city of

~Ploo~.  Dozens of aquatic fish swim about the domed windows, and you can

simply point to the fish of your desire and it will be captured and cooked

for you in under 30 seconds!



Also remarkable is the bewildering variety of ethnic restauraunts located on

the surface.  Many also cater to the more exotic tastes by serving the patrons

of competing restauraunts, literally!  Anything edible [and some things that

aren't] can be purchased here at a competitive price.



~Culture:~



Savara is the eclectic hub of the sector, where many varied cultures live

together in apparent peace and harmony, though you'll want to avoid these areas

since few tourists leave them alive.  However, you can sit behind glass

enclosures as you watch the race of your choice go about their daily tasks,

unable to stop you from prying into their private affairs.



Also available is the Bring it to You service, where for a small fee the

locals will run out and round up a few ethnic groups of your choice who will

be forced to act as if they enjoy your presence.  A must for the self-conscious

traveller!



~Entertainment:~



Savara is the merchant center of the sector, where just about anything you want

and everything you don't want can be found at an agressive price.  Price

fixing and Mob control have seen that no individual merchants will ever charge

anything that isn't fair.



Also, you will definitely want to visit the ~Interstellar~ ~House~ ~of~

great world of Gruel.  A fun affair for the whole family!

  ~DELIANI:~



~Travel Tip:~



Though most areas of the planet are restricted and guards are often ordered

to shoot unidentified personnel on sight, if you stay in the Light Green Zone

you should have no problems avoiding personal injury and death.  Be sure to

avoid the Blue-Green and Turquoise Zones as well as the Stix Zone.  The

Red and Yellow Zones are safe for travel, though the Yellow is often confused

with the Off-White and Peach Deadly Areas.  Many a color-blind traveller has

been killed by accident.



~Dining:~



Deliani provides the most technically advanced cooking systems in the known

universe.  Dishes that simply aren't palatable anywhere else still won't be

very good here, but Chef Yo of Deliani's motto is:  If it's matter, we can

make you eat it.  A unique experience you'll never be able to repeat!



~Culture:~



One word: Robotics.  Anyone's fetish for robotics can be satisfied here.

Androbots, Lobots, Robots, Androids, Redroids, Droid Droids, and many other

varieties of metallic life forms are welcome here, as long as they stay in the

Burnt Sienna or Brick Red Zones.



Deliani is the home of such ~Fluxnet~ ~21~ favorites as Honey, I Shorted-Out

the Kidforms - Almo and Zik-Nar X3 - My Mother the Lobot.



~Entertainment:~



Gencore always has a number of exciting entertainment opportunities available

for tourists.  Any number of military drills, parades, and barbaric information

torture drills can be found here.  A must for military buffs.

Scenic guide to the universe: ~Ixmucane~

Windy

  ~IXMUCANE:~



The original headquarters of Microsol.  This planet has a very dry

and desert-like surface with the occasional mountain range.  The advantage of

this world is its weak inner crust, allowing Microsol to build

gigantic research facilities undergound.  Immense domed cities can be seen

in major research and production locations.  The tragedy of Ixmucane is that it

was originally the home of the ~Zica~, an unknown race of alien that

originally carved immeasurable labrynthine tunnel systems under the

surface.

The ~Zica~ are feared by xenoscientists, who believe that the they have fled

to the outer reaches of the sector where they plan to launch a massive attack

on Deliani and Microsol, using outer-dimensional technology.

But is it true...?



And, if so, will I, the writer, ever grow bored enough to write the sequel

using this suggested plotline?

Scenic guide to the universe: ~Torm~

Windy

  ~TORM:~



A rubnik is worth a thousand words on this planet.



Sector capital and regional chapter of the Interplanetary Government.  Torm is

one of the largest worlds in the sector, surpassed in size only by the ice

world of Camanis. The surface is similar to Savara's, though consisting of

grasslands and heavily forested mountain regions.  The city capital, Portoch,

is a metropolis of corruption and dark, rainy days.



~Dining:~



Torm is a vegetarian's delight or worst nightmare.  Twenty-eight thousand

types of vegetarian dishes are served daily, with another Sixty thousand

on request.  Also prevalent is a large selection of animal dishes with the

ever-popular and expensive ~dragon~ ~succotash~.  Many people save up their

whole lives just to order this dish once.  Many others succumb to the toxic

nature of the dish, but what a way to go.



~Culture:~



Only make a visit to be depressed, since the buildings are so neglected they

are streaked with dirt.  It is said that the chapter lords are so decadent

that they seldom emerge from the local simulation clubs.  The city itself is

an example of why Microsol holds so much sway in governmental policies: bribery.



~Entertainment:~



On Torm, you can partake of the most degrading sports and acts known in the

universe.  Few ever leave this planet the same, and fewer even leave - or can.

A visit to this planet is one you won't easily miss.  Be sure to bring a

bodyguard.  Actually, bring a whole army.  You'll need them.

HOW TO PLAY

Game

How to play the secret ending game ~ZINGLON'S~ ~SQUADRONS~: [~ZINGALA~]



Large formations of ships fly down to attack you.  Individual ships in the

groups break off to fly down in various ways.  You must destroy the entire

fleet to advance to the next fleet.  Basically, just shoot everything you

can.



You must shoot all the small enemies to advance to the next level.



There are 7 kinds of enemies:



~Zimbles~ : 10 pts / 20 pts attacking : Damage 4 : Eyeballs



~Blottes~ : 15 pts / 30 pts attacking : Damage 6 : Blood Cells



~Zoomers~ : 20 pts / 40 pts attacking : Damage 5 : Bombs



~Roobles~ : 25 pts / 50 pts attacking : Damage 5 : Fireballs



~Tokkies~ : 50 pts / 100 pts attacking : Damage 7 : Little Spikey Balls



~Garmons~ : 100 pts / 200-300 pts attacking : Damage 10 : Big Spikey Balls



~Widgets~ : 250 pts / 500-??? pts attacking : Damage 20 : Big Brown Ship



Your ship is armed with a simple rail gun which cannot be increased.  Also,

you have no shields and merely subsist on armor.  However, the armor ship will

still come down to help you.



Extra lives are earned at 10000, 20000, and every 25000 pts thereafter.

STRATEGY

Game

Strategy Guide for ~ZINGLON'S~ ~SQUADRONS~: [~ZINGALA~]



There are four types of enemy formations:



Type 1 : ~Block~ : A simple four row mass of enemies.  They attack quickly but

if you don't care about your score you can blast through them pretty quickly.



Type 2 : ~Bombs~ : This block variation has a row of bombs in the front which

are difficult to destroy and fly down quickly.  If you can blast through them,

you can get a clear shot at the Garmons.  The center Garmon will not move, so

try to take it out before the formation leaves for extra points.



Type 3 : ~Delta~ : This is not a difficult formation at first, as you can take

out the side enemies fairly quickly.  Unfortunately, the center Tokkies will

fly out at you extremely quickly and are difficult to anticipate.  Don't let

the Zimbles get close to the bottom or else you may have difficulty maneuvering.



Type 4 : ~Bonus~ : This is a very quick formation for extra points.  The

Zoomers and Roobles will attack in force first.  Then, the Widget will attack.

Make sure you destroy this!  After the Widget will come some more small ships

and the two remaining Garmons.



There are no special moves available in this game.

Dougan

Trent?  I've picked you up on my sensors.



No time to talk!  There's a ~Microsol~ freak on my tail and I'm flying unarmed.

I'll be ok as long as I can stay out of range.  That weird ninja guy with the

stealth ship is moving in to help.



I'll contact you again when I'm able.  Good luck.



Dougan out.

Reid

Trent, am I glad to see you!  Microsol has destroyed most of the defenses on

Savara and the rest have been taken over.  They came quickly.  Someone has

sold our planet out to them.  Who?



I am glad to know you are out there.  I and many others have taken refuge

in shelters below ground.  They have control of the ~Central~ ~Defense~ ~Ship~.



A handful of others are already fighting on the surface, but we are sorely

outnumbered.



I must go.  We need to conserve battery power for the hospitals.  They have

severely damaged the fusion generators.

TOP SECRET

Confidential memo #4410-303-TDCam



Laser research is progressing steadily, according to projections.



Project Thermos has completed stage 2 and is moving to the final stage 3.  We

anticipate having a prototype stage 3 laser cannon very soon.



Camanis research station Loopy is prepared to ship 3 modified battle cruisers

to you as soon as we receive word from you.  Planetary coordinates for pickup

are 399 x 21.



We need confirmation immediately.  So far, we don't believe any enemy forces

have learned of our position, but we only have a skeleton defense force.  No

main battle cruisers are currently online.  This leaves us especially vulnerable

to outside attack.



This is Mycroft Dalo, Microsol Research Control, signing off.

[Cheerful, brightly lit living room.  Late 103rd century decor.]



When dreaded alien parasites are drilling into my head, I reach for ~Alambusol~.



~Alambusol~ is the only anti-parasite xeno-spray which I trust.  Two squirts and

ten minutes later, my head is clear and free of infestation once again.



[Cut to Medical office.  Very modern.]



Yes, four out of our five doctors recommend ~Alambusol~ to their infested

patients.  The other doctor was fired.  So, you can see that we are firmly

commited to using this spray on our patients.



[Quick wipe down to scene of rendered Spray bottle floating in a stasis field.]



So transmit a bottle of ~Alambusol~ to yourself today!  You won't be sorry.

Scenic guide to the universe: ~Camanis~

Guidebook

  ~CAMANIS:~



~Dining:~



Located 2 miles east of the Ultra-secret Microsol research station is the

All-powerful Bob Hartley's ~IceCream-O-Matic~.  The ultimate in high-powered

instant cryo manufacturing facilities, the ICOM system can instantaneously

generate up to 3 cubic miles of ice cream, in any of 24 billion flavors.



Microsol has made this possible by purchasing out all other ice cream manufacturing

facilities and amassing the recipes of every vendor who has ever existed.



This bewildering decision rocked the world of ice cream futures but made

Microsol the undisputed master of all the ice cream in the universe.  They take

their ice seriously.



~Culture:~



Not many people enjoy living in the sub-zero confines of this planet.  Because

of this, they are an extremely proud people, prone to bawling out wimps like

you who have climate control.  If you visit, be sure not to mention how cold

it is unless you want a very one-sided conversation.  Steer your topics

toward their lovely scenery and extensive museums of ice sculptures.



~Entertainment:~



A skiiers dream.  This is the cold vacation spot of the universe.  Millions of

ski slopes litter the world, providing entertainment to endless visitors each

year.  Camanis boasts year-round snow and optional near-zero visibility for the

ultra-suicidal skiier.  What more could one ask for?



For the friends of those suicidal skiiers who are dragged along on vacation,

try out your hand at massive free-form laser ice sculpture.  For a small fee

per hour, you can have the enjoyment of carving up your very own mountain.

If you simply must take it back home with you, Camanis even offers 2nd minute

delivery!  All you have to do is to find a place to store your mountain and

keep it cool.  An adventure for the whole family!
