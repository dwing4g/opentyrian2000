Monses walked upon Savara and said:
摩西行走在萨瓦拉，说道：

"Let there be a group of laws for people to follow, so that they might learn
“要有一套律法供人们遵循，这样他们才能学会行善，
to be virtuous and live with honor."

And ~Zinglon~ said:
而~劲仑~说：

"Lo, let be it, for now when Tuesday then cometh with not again, be it
“好吧，就让它如此吧。因为当周二不再来临时，
another less more it be.  Be faith giveth whence came me unto, yet not needeth
它就不再是多出来的那一个了。信仰赐予我力量，

“嗯？”

And ~Zinglon~ spake:

“看。这就是你要的东西。拿走吧，别烦我了。”

Monses took the ~holocubes~ from the sky but saw that there was an extra cube,

“你知道什么时候人们会发现十个方块还是不够用？
This is for that extra push when ten just isn't enough."

Monses scratched his head and replied:
蒙塞斯挠了挠头，回答道：

"Surely you could make the other ten stronger?"
“你难道不能让其他十个人更强壮一些吗？”
