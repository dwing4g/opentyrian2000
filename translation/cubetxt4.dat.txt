You must seal off the planet.



Or else...



~Transon~.  We have made it our primary concern to keep the ~A1~ ~UPLINK~ open.  If

you can not stop the fleet from taking total control of the planet, you will

have to activate the ~Nova~ system.  I do not think it will take them too long

to find us once we jettison ourselves from the planet core.



Make them suffer, ~Transon~.  I... would.

Thanks, ~Transon~.  While the mice are away, the cat will play.  Heh.

Something's going on down there on ~Deliani~!



I'm sure you read the two previous messages.



What can we do?  You've got to fly ahead and distract them until we arrive,

somehow.  We've sent out a droneship to attach some booster packs to your

ship.  They should be enough to get you to ~Deliani~.  We'll try to get some

equipment to you along the way and once you reach the planet.



You now know as much as I do, ~Trent~.  I can't believe they were able to

get this fleet out undetected.  Something's going on - I don't like this

one bit.  We've been picking up ~unknown~, strange ships and energy patterns the

whole time while in orbit around this planet.



The universe is erupting into chaos, ~Trent~!  This is the only chance to save

what's left!  If you fail, we'll never be able to reach the planet in time,

even if we wanted to destroy it.  I can't tell you what the ~Nova~ system is

on this link,

but suffice it to say - it was our final hope in case we couldn't stop

Microsol someday.  It seems that day has passed me by - the blind fool I've been!

With ~Vykromod~ crippled from the blast you gave his ship, I've taken command

of the fleet.



I've got a nasty surprise waiting down here.  So come on, ~Trent~, be the

hero you've always wanted to be and come after me.  I've got other engagements,

though, once I've blasted the irritating fool in this escape pod.



You're too insignificant to be a part of my plan.  I'd be amazed if you make

it past the missile bays.

Are you Trent?  I have heard of you from ~Transon~.



Forgive me for not introducing myself, but a certain ~crazed~ ~lunatic~ is

hammering on my pod's shielding with ~Lightning~ blasts.  I do not believe there

is a very good probability we will survive much longer, but I need to tell you

what you are up against.



The main defense net consists of ~battle~ ~platforms~.  Most of these launch

~semi-guided~ ~micro~ ~missiles~, though some fire more mundane ~energy~ ~blasts~.  The

missiles are what you should first look out for, though.  I would suggest

equipping some direct ~side-firing~ ~weaponry~ if you have it available.



Halfway through the core you will encounter a large ~battle~ ~section~ which you

should take out first.  This is fairly straightforward, but afterward you will be

attacked with a number of ~giant~ ~semi-guided~ ~missiles~ from behind.  Do not

attempt to destroy these.  Instead, try to conserve your energy and find a way

around them, while keeping a hold on those ~micro~ ~missiles~.



The final ~fleet~ ~ship~ seems to be a multi-stage defense

We've picked up your transmission of success in defeating the main defense

ship.  I don't mean to criticize your ability, but that seemed too easy.



I think we can repair the damage you did to Deliani without too much trouble.

At least, once we get back into the computer net.  With Mondus, the head

of ~Deliani~ ~Control~, destroyed, we're going to have a tough time trying to

reinterface with the computer.  With all the people you helped us rescue,

the ~IcoStar~ ~II~ should have enough brainpower to crack the security

fairly soon, I hope.



This definitely wasn't their main objective.  We tried to pick up a ~Captain~

~Nob~ escaping from ~Ixmucane~, but were unable to stop him.  All we know is that

he was heading in the direction of ~Savara~.  We sent some supply ships on

ahead to rendezvous with you and some other fighter ships we just dispatched.



They'll be moving in first to take out the chemical processing plants, which

should draw their energy production systems to a halt.  I'm afraid I rebuilt the ~Z-29~

~Central~ ~Defense~ ~Ship~ again, and we improved on the design.

~Microsol's~ probably already captured it with the same security backdoors

they used here.  Sorry.  I need you to go and destroy it again.



Once we get back in and get our sensor grid up we'll be able to help you

some more in locating ~Microsol's~ main target.



Good luck, Trent.

This is your old friend, Trent.  I've managed to take out the ~chemical~

My long-range sensors have detected a ~gigantic~ ~ship~ heading our way.  It's

not the size that bothers me, though.  It's not really all that big in size,

but the ~energy~ ~readings~ I'm getting from it are off the ~scale~.



It appears to also have an ~insane~ ~mass~ ~analysis~ ~reading~, like it was

something as massive as a ~planet~.  I don't like this, Trent.  I must deal

with the ships down here on Savara, but it appears to be interested only in

you, as it's ~matching~ ~your~ ~course~ exactly.



There's about one hour left before it reaches orbit.  My ship is... damaged.

I must humbly admit I won't be able to achieve orbit on my own.  I'm sorry

I couldn't help you out this time, but it is best that I stay and help these

innocents here on Savara, anyway.

I intercepted the other trasmissions you received and don't like either of

them very much, ~Javi~ more so.  I think I can help you out, though.  My ship

isn't equipped for combat, but I've got a heavy-duty ~VLR~ ~sensor~ ~grid~ and a

~TQ930~ ~comm~ ~system~ packed in this baby.  If you keep your comm channel open,

I'll try to feed your computer some holographic data on the dreadnought's weak

points.



It seems that the shielding on that ship is being disrupted by the weird

~gravity~ ~field~, and whenever certain systems are activated, it draws a lot of

power from the shields.  I'll try to pinpoint the ~weaknesses~ for you.  Your

computer will display them on your vidscreen with ~green~, ~holographic~ ~arrows~.

Hello, Trent.  I have picked you up on my comm link again.



Things aren't going too well down here.  Without an outside energy boost, I'm

not sure if our ships are going to hold out.  About half of our group is gone

already and the rest are damaged.



Without outside help, we will not have enough fuel to return home.



Sigh...



Anyway, let's talk some more about hot dogs.  Did you pick some up for me

one of those right now.

Great job!  We could see the explosion all the way back down here on Savara!

Trent, the others down here aren't doing so well.  I can't help them out

directly, so I've gone back into orbit to try and contact Transon.  Have

you heard anything?



I hope I can get through for backup before we're taken out.  Almost none of us

have operational interstellar drives, and it doesn't look like anyone down

here can help us.



Anyway, I've got a long-range sensor report for you.  Their main battle ships

are headed toward ~Gyges~ for some reason.  If you can, head for ~Gyges~.  I

think they're getting ready to do something really bad now that we've stopped

their main assault.  I'd rather not be here when they're ready.



I may lose contact with you if we can't capture ~Fluxnet~ here on Savara.

Without it, my comm signals won't have the range to reach you out there.



From now on, I'm afraid you're flying blind.  I pray to ~Zinglon~ that ~Transon~

can get the Deli back online.

a cube he had not expected.  He interrupted again and spake to the heavens:



"What's the other cube for?"



And ~Zinglon~ spake:



"You know when the people have learned but the ten cubes just aren't enough?

This is for that extra push when ten just isn't enough."



Monses scratched his head and replied:



"Surely you could make the other ten stronger?"



And ~Zinglon~ spake:



"But mine go up to ~eleven~.  Now go away."



And, ~Zinglon~ blew Monses and the ~holocubes~ off the mountain...



Enjoy these scenes and more from the greatest production of all time!

WHO ARE YOU?

I... I feel your presence, Trent.  Where are you?  I cannot see.



What have you done to me, Trent?  I feel... nothing.



Where is my body?  Who am I?  Am I still me?



I want to die.  Why can't I move?



Kill me.  Someone?



Trent?

HELP ME.

Vykromod

Again, I feel your presence, Trent.  I can move now.  I don't know quite

what I have become, but I know what I must do.  I feel you are the cause

of my pain.



Come to me, Trent.  One of us must die before the other can become whole.



I... don't know what that means.  You must come.  I... must be me again.



Something is about to happen.  I can feel it.

Transon

Trent, this is Transon Lohk.



I hope you are able to get this message.  We've lost you on our sensors.

Your ship disappeared about 8 minutes ago.  Where are you?



Your life is in danger.  I am sure of it.



A great power surge is building from within Gyges.  I don't know what it is,

but you must investigate.  Perhaps you already know.  There is no time to

send any backup to help you.  You'll have to make do with what you can find

around there.



The fleet at Savara has been disabled - many were lost.  We don't have the

specific details, but we're looking for survivors.  Anyway, there is no-one

left who can reach you that far out there.  You're on your own.



Good luck, Trent.  I only wish I knew what was going on out there.  I know

you will do your best.  We will try to contact you again later.



Transon out.





[Unknown ID:]  Commander, quick, what's the square root of 4?  I think the

computer is down and we can't figure out how to fix it!



[Transon:]  Two.  You know, ensign, you have the brain of a pea.  If I was to

collect your mind and hold it for ransom, I wouldn't be able to prove it was

anything but a grain of sand.



[Unknown ID:]  Sorry, Commander.



[Transon:]  Do you have any idea what's going on out there?



[Unknown ID:]  Sorry, Commander?



[Transon:]  About Trent.



[Unknown iD:]  Ooo.  Sorry, Commander.



[Transon:]  He's going to [~chuckle~] save the universe again.  And then, do you

know what he'll probably do?



[Unknown ID:]  Sorry, Commander?



[Transon:]  He'll save the universe again, and again, and again!  He'll do

anything I want him to do to help the universe and I won't have to lift a

finger to do anything except send him these little messages like... oops...

HOLO NEWS - XP9 v123-02-39

News

This is Rob Neither with the daily news.



~Zinglon's~ ~Nose~ ~Stolen~



A holy artifact believed to be the nose of Zinglon himself was stolen from the

Torm Orbiting Museum.  Religious followers are in an uproar and demand that

the party responsible return the nose immediately.  A full-scale investigation

has been launched and several planets are fully mobilizing for jihad - holy war.



~Ixmucane~ ~Threatened~ ~With~ ~Destruction~ -

~1.5~ ~Million~ ~to~ ~Be~ ~Killed~



In other news, Microsol has reportedly threatened the extinction of 1.5

million scientists and engineers on the planet Ixmucane.  A small relief fleet

has been called in, headed mainly by Gencore, to save as many people as possible.



[Clara, Co-reporter [~CC~]] : Does it really matter, Rob?  I'm beginning to think

there's nowhere in the galaxy not under some mysterious threat, but somehow it

all seems to work out fairly easily with no deaths on our side.  Isn't this

some kind of a hoax?



[Rob, Reporter [~RR~]] : Seems that way to me.  I can remember when a war was

something you could ~feel~.  Not just some report on how many scraps of metal

were found.  To date, there has been no real evidence of any Gencore or other

alliance ships participating in any major conflict.  Just minor skirmishes

with scout ships on our side.



[~CC~] : So this ~is~ some kind of hoax?



[~RR~] : Probably.  It's this lack of standards that make me wish I was back in

holo-sports.  Now that had a future.  This fake war is making me sick.  There's

nothing worse than someone manufacturing a war by exploding tons of robot

starships.  Nothing but a big fireworks display.

Hello, self.  We're going to die, we know.  I thought we knew that.



I must admit, I am rather tired of saving the universe again and again.  That

idiot Transon will find me no matter where I go and force me to take on huge

fleets until I either die or grow old.  Maybe he'll find a way around that.

I've got to get out of here!  There must be somewhere I can go where people

won't expect me to take out entire planets by myself.



But where?



I must find a way!  Otherwise I'll be stuck fighting these Microsol ships for

the rest of eternity!  ~Aaaaarrrrrggghhh!~

HOW TO PLAY

Game

How to play the secret ending game ~ZINGLON'S~ ~REVENGE~:



A giant ship projects a horizontal field of energy.  Small enemies fall down

from above and bounce around the edges of the screen and against the energy

field.  Touching the field or one of the little enemies means almost certain

instant death.



You must shoot all the small enemies to advance to the next level.



There are 4 kinds of enemies:



~Roobles~ : Round Fireballs - Low damage - Move left to right



~Tokkies~ : Spikey Balls - Low damage - Move up and down quickly



~Zimbles~ : Eyeballs - Moderate damage - Move diagonally slowly



~Blottes~ : Blood Cells - High damage - Descend slowly and then bounce up quickly

diagonally





This game consists of 6 levels, starting on ~level~ ~5~ and descending in order

to the final level.



Level 5 : Mostly Roobles



Level 4 : Mostly Tokkies



Extra ship received after Level 5.



Level 3 : Zimbles and Blottes



Level 2 : Roobles, Tokkies, and Blottes



Level 1 : Mostly Zimbles



Extra ship received after Level 1.



Level 0 : Blottes - Destroy the energy field?



Extra ship received after Level 0.



Level -1 : ???

STRATEGY

Game

Strategy Guide for ~ZINGLON'S~ ~REVENGE~:



Obviously the main point to the game is to dodge the little enemies as well

as possible.



~Roobles~ : Round Fireballs - These are very easy to destroy but get in your

way easily once they descend fairly low.  Try to take these out quickly if

you can unless a Blotte is coming.



~Tokkies~ : Spikey Balls - These can be avoided fairly easily since they move

very slowly across the screen.  You can usually position a sidekick to stay

underneath them long enough to take them out.



~Zimbles~ : Eyeballs - These are pretty slow and you can usually delay shooting

them until they start filling the screen.  Try to take out the faster-moving

enemies first if you can.



~Blottes~ : Blood Cells - These are the hardest enemies to destroy in the game.

They are fairly easy to take out while descending, so try to at least to damage

them fairly well.  Once they reach bottom, they'll start bouncing quickly and

can be hard to destroy.



~SECRET~:



Yes, of course there are secret moves in this game.  ~21~ of them, in fact.



Several of the more common ones are detailed below:



~Sidekicks:~ Attach one or two of these to your ship.



  Red sidekick : Press Right,Down,Left, then hold Fire and press Up.



~Hot Dog:~ A blast of deadly dogs.  Uses up your armor slowly, though.



  Press Up, then hold Fire and press Down.



Of course, ~all~ other special moves are also available here.



Good luck!



So far, even the designer has problems winning this game, as it should be!

My general time to beat is ~3:30~, without using many secret moves.

Scenic guide to the universe: ~Savara~

Windy

  ~SAVARA:~



~Dining:~



Come and visit the interstellar dining halls in the underwater city of

~Ploo~.  Dozens of aquatic fish swim about the domed windows, and you can

simply point to the fish of your desire and it will be captured and cooked

for you in under 30 seconds!



Also remarkable is the bewildering variety of ethnic restauraunts located on

the surface.  Many also cater to the more exotic tastes by serving the patrons

of competing restauraunts, literally!  Anything edible [and some things that

aren't] can be purchased here at a competitive price.



~Culture:~



Savara is the eclectic hub of the sector, where many varied cultures live

together in apparent peace and harmony, though you'll want to avoid these areas

since few tourists leave them alive.  However, you can sit behind glass

enclosures as you watch the race of your choice go about their daily tasks,

unable to stop you from prying into their private affairs.



Also available is the Bring it to You service, where for a small fee the

locals will run out and round up a few ethnic groups of your choice who will

be forced to act as if they enjoy your presence.  A must for the self-conscious

traveller!



~Entertainment:~



Savara is the merchant center of the sector, where just about anything you want

and everything you don't want can be found at an agressive price.  Price

fixing and Mob control have seen that no individual merchants will ever charge

anything that isn't fair.



Also, you will definitely want to visit the ~Interstellar~ ~House~ ~of~

~Gruel~ wherein you will see the fascinating history and story behind the

great world of Gruel.  A fun affair for the whole family!

Scenic guide to the universe: ~Deliani~

Windy

  ~DELIANI:~



~Travel Tip:~



Though most areas of the planet are restricted and guards are often ordered

to shoot unidentified personnel on sight, if you stay in the Light Green Zone

you should have no problems avoiding personal injury and death.  Be sure to

avoid the Blue-Green and Turquoise Zones as well as the Stix Zone.  The

Red and Yellow Zones are safe for travel, though the Yellow is often confused

with the Off-White and Peach Deadly Areas.  Many a color-blind traveller has

been killed by accident.



~Dining:~



Deliani provides the most technically advanced cooking systems in the known

universe.  Dishes that simply aren't palatable anywhere else still won't be

very good here, but Chef Yo of Deliani's motto is:  If it's matter, we can

make you eat it.  A unique experience you'll never be able to repeat!



~Culture:~



One word: Robotics.  Anyone's fetish for robotics can be satisfied here.

Androbots, Lobots, Robots, Androids, Redroids, Droid Droids, and many other

varieties of metallic life forms are welcome here, as long as they stay in the

Burnt Sienna or Brick Red Zones.



Deliani is the home of such ~Fluxnet~ ~21~ favorites as Honey, I Shorted-Out

the Kidforms - Almo and Zik-Nar X3 - My Mother the Lobot.



~Entertainment:~



Gencore always has a number of exciting entertainment opportunities available

for tourists.  Any number of military drills, parades, and barbaric information

torture drills can be found here.  A must for military buffs.



*57 03

Scenic guide to the universe: ~Ixmucane~

Windy

  ~IXMUCANE:~



The original headquarters of Microsol.  This planet has a very dry

and desert-like surface with the occasional mountain range.  The advantage of

this world is its weak inner crust, allowing Microsol to build

gigantic research facilities undergound.  Immense domed cities can be seen

in major research and production locations.  The tragedy of Ixmucane is that it

was originally the home of the ~Zica~, an unknown race of alien that

originally carved immeasurable labrynthine tunnel systems under the

surface.

The ~Zica~ are feared by xenoscientists, who believe that the they have fled

to the outer reaches of the sector where they plan to launch a massive attack

on Deliani and Microsol, using outer-dimensional technology.

But is it true...?



And, if so, will I, the writer, ever grow bored enough to write the sequel

using this suggested plotline?



*58 03

Scenic guide to the universe: ~Torm~

Windy

  ~TORM:~



A rubnik is worth a thousand words on this planet.



Sector capital and regional chapter of the Interplanetary Government.  Torm is

one of the largest worlds in the sector, surpassed in size only by the ice

world of Camanis. The surface is similar to Savara's, though consisting of

grasslands and heavily forested mountain regions.  The city capital, Portoch,

is a metropolis of corruption and dark, rainy days.



~Dining:~



Torm is a vegetarian's delight or worst nightmare.  Twenty-eight thousand

types of vegetarian dishes are served daily, with another Sixty thousand

on request.  Also prevalent is a large selection of animal dishes with the

ever-popular and expensive ~dragon~ ~succotash~.  Many people save up their

whole lives just to order this dish once.  Many others succumb to the toxic

nature of the dish, but what a way to go.



~Culture:~



Only make a visit to be depressed, since the buildings are so neglected they

are streaked with dirt.  It is said that the chapter lords are so decadent

that they seldom emerge from the local simulation clubs.  The city itself is

an example of why Microsol holds so much sway in governmental policies: bribery.



~Entertainment:~



On Torm, you can partake of the most degrading sports and acts known in the

universe.  Few ever leave this planet the same, and fewer even leave - or can.

A visit to this planet is one you won't easily miss.  Be sure to bring a

bodyguard.  Actually, bring a whole army.  You'll need them.

HOW TO PLAY

Game

How to play the secret ending game ~ZINGLON'S~ ~SQUADRONS~: [~ZINGALA~]



Large formations of ships fly down to attack you.  Individual ships in the

groups break off to fly down in various ways.  You must destroy the entire

fleet to advance to the next fleet.  Basically, just shoot everything you

can.



You must shoot all the small enemies to advance to the next level.



There are 7 kinds of enemies:



~Zimbles~ : 10 pts / 20 pts attacking : Damage 4 : Eyeballs



~Blottes~ : 15 pts / 30 pts attacking : Damage 6 : Blood Cells



~Zoomers~ : 20 pts / 40 pts attacking : Damage 5 : Bombs



~Roobles~ : 25 pts / 50 pts attacking : Damage 5 : Fireballs



~Tokkies~ : 50 pts / 100 pts attacking : Damage 7 : Little Spikey Balls



~Garmons~ : 100 pts / 200-300 pts attacking : Damage 10 : Big Spikey Balls



~Widgets~ : 250 pts / 500-??? pts attacking : Damage 20 : Big Brown Ship



Your ship is armed with a simple rail gun which cannot be increased.  Also,

you have no shields and merely subsist on armor.  However, the armor ship will

still come down to help you.



Extra lives are earned at 10000, 20000, and every 25000 pts thereafter.

STRATEGY

Game

Strategy Guide for ~ZINGLON'S~ ~SQUADRONS~: [~ZINGALA~]



There are four types of enemy formations:



Type 1 : ~Block~ : A simple four row mass of enemies.  They attack quickly but

if you don't care about your score you can blast through them pretty quickly.



Type 2 : ~Bombs~ : This block variation has a row of bombs in the front which

are difficult to destroy and fly down quickly.  If you can blast through them,

you can get a clear shot at the Garmons.  The center Garmon will not move, so

try to take it out before the formation leaves for extra points.



Type 3 : ~Delta~ : This is not a difficult formation at first, as you can take

out the side enemies fairly quickly.  Unfortunately, the center Tokkies will

fly out at you extremely quickly and are difficult to anticipate.  Don't let

the Zimbles get close to the bottom or else you may have difficulty maneuvering.



Type 4 : ~Bonus~ : This is a very quick formation for extra points.  The

Zoomers and Roobles will attack in force first.  Then, the Widget will attack.

Make sure you destroy this!  After the Widget will come some more small ships

and the two remaining Garmons.



There are no special moves available in this game.

We need confirmation immediately.  So far, we don't believe any enemy forces

Guidebook

  ~CAMANIS:~



~Dining:~



Located 2 miles east of the Ultra-secret Microsol research station is the

All-powerful Bob Hartley's ~IceCream-O-Matic~.  The ultimate in high-powered

instant cryo manufacturing facilities, the ICOM system can instantaneously

generate up to 3 cubic miles of ice cream, in any of 24 billion flavors.



Microsol has made this possible by purchasing out all other ice cream manufacturing

facilities and amassing the recipes of every vendor who has ever existed.



This bewildering decision rocked the world of ice cream futures but made

Microsol the undisputed master of all the ice cream in the universe.  They take

their ice seriously.



~Culture:~



Not many people enjoy living in the sub-zero confines of this planet.  Because

of this, they are an extremely proud people, prone to bawling out wimps like

you who have climate control.  If you visit, be sure not to mention how cold

it is unless you want a very one-sided conversation.  Steer your topics

toward their lovely scenery and extensive museums of ice sculptures.



~Entertainment:~



A skiiers dream.  This is the cold vacation spot of the universe.  Millions of

ski slopes litter the world, providing entertainment to endless visitors each

year.  Camanis boasts year-round snow and optional near-zero visibility for the

ultra-suicidal skiier.  What more could one ask for?



For the friends of those suicidal skiiers who are dragged along on vacation,

try out your hand at massive free-form laser ice sculpture.  For a small fee

per hour, you can have the enjoyment of carving up your very own mountain.

If you simply must take it back home with you, Camanis even offers 2nd minute

delivery!  All you have to do is to find a place to store your mountain and

keep it cool.  An adventure for the whole family!
